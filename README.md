# Math Whiz

## Objective
When my favorite math flashcards app updated, it lost the simple and effective functionality I used every day. Instead of giving up on it, I decided to rebuild it myself.  

Using JavaScript, React, Vite, TypeScript, GitHub, and AI tools, I developed Math Whiz — a customizable and adaptive math flashcard app. Along the way, I added new features like fraction operations and performance tracking, creating a more powerful and versatile learning tool.  

The goal: provide an adaptable resource for practicing mental math while strengthening my own skills with modern development and AI-assisted workflows.
